# UML diagram for the project

The project's core class is the `LibrarySystem` class which uses the singleton pattern to ensure that only one instance of the class is created. The `LibrarySystem` class contains `Book`, `User` and `Lending` objects.
The `Main` class provides a simple textual user interface for the library system using private methods.
